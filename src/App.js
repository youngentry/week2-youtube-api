        "Hey guys! So, today I am going to be doing a very long awaited request (or....demand) from my audience to paint/customize an entire deck of playing cards using my original characters. There are 52 cards in a deck, plus 2 jokers (which I am going to include), so this is a HUGE project. Let's see how far I get this week....\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try). \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nEvery Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs\n\n____DOWNLOAD SPARK____\nDownload Spark: https://apple.co/3gPrlWP\nJoin Discord Community: https://discord.gg/w48nSSm3s4\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:\nArtwork@Moriah.video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\nmoriah@nightmedia.co\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.
